A little bit about me...
I received my Phd in Linguistics from <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/linguistics/">The University of Texas at Austin</a> in May 2020. I have been at the <a href="https://utsoundlab.wordpress.com/"> UTsoundLab </a> (PI: Dr. Rajka Smiljanic) since 2015. 
My research focuses on experimental phonetics, speech perception and production, first and second language processing and auditory memory. 

My dissertation examined memory for speech of varying intelligibility: effects of perception and production of clear speech on recall and recognition memory for native and non-native listeners and talkers. Peer-reviewed articles from dissertation <a href="https://skrstck.github.io/2018/Publication/">#1</a> and <a href="https://skrstck.github.io/2019/Publication/">#2</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gori8gyUX-s">click here</a> to see a narrated recording of my dissertation slides.

I use GitHub/this page to host some of my research output. For a full list of publications and activities, here is my CV:
