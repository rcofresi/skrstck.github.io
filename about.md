A little bit about me...
I received my Phd in Linguistics from The University of Texas at Austin in May 2020. I have been at the <a href="https://utsoundlab.wordpress.com/"> UTsoundLab </a> (PI: Dr. Rajka Smiljanic) since 2015. 
My research focuses on experimental phonetics, speech perception and production, first and second language processing and auditory memory. 

<br>My dissertation examined memory for speech of varying intelligibility: effects of perception and production of clear speech on recall and recognition memory for native and non-native listeners and talkers.
