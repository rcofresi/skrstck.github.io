A little bit about me...
I received my Phd in Linguistics from The University of Texas at Austin in May 2020. I have been in the <a href="https://utsoundlab.wordpress.com/"> UTsoundLab </a> (PI: Dr. Rajka Smiljanic) since 2015. 
My research focuses on experimental phonetics, speech perception and production, first and second language processing and auditory memory. 

<br>My dissertation examined memory for speech of varying intelligibility: effects of perception and production of clear speech on recall and recognition memory for native and non-native listeners and talkers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gori8gyUX-s"> Click here</a> to see a narrated recording of my dissertation slides.

<br> From my dissertation, 2 papers were published in the peer-reviewed <i>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</i>:

<div>1.<b> Keerstock, S.</b>, & Smiljanic, R. (2019). Clear speech improves listeners’ recall. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 146(6), 4604–4610.
